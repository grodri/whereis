Title:
whereis: a module for keeping track of ancillary programs, files and folders

Description:
Stata programs that use external programs or files that are not in the ado path, 
for example the pandoc document converter, need to know the location of the 
resource. The -whereis- command helps users and developers alike by maintaining 
a directory of programs, files and folders. The user stores the full path to the 
resource by typing in Stata -whereis name location- using a unique name and the 
full path. A program that needs the resource calls -whereis name- and retrieves 
the location from a macro -r(name)- named after the resource. An advantage over 
the alternative of storing resource locations in global macros in profile.do is 
that -whereis- checks that the file or folder exists at the specified location.
